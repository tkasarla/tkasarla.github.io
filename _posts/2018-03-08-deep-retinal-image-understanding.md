### Approach of the paper
Specialized task of a base segmentation network to specific tasks like - blood vessel segmentation and optical disk segmentation - in the retina
 * basenet - VGGnet
 * task specific specialized convolutional layers - inspired by GoogLeNet

#### Specifics of the network
- specialized layers add supervision to multiple internal layers.
- it produces feature maps in __k__ different channels which are resized to original image size and concatenated thereby creating fine to coarse feature maps
- a last convolutional layer linearly combines the feauture maps created by specialized layer to regressed result.
- class balanced cross entropy to train the network to detect contours.
- first 4 finer feature maps for __blood vessel segmentation__ and last 4 coarse feature maps for __optic disk segmentation__
