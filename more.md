## Coffee

Inspired by coffee pages from other researchers: [Justine Sherry](http://www.justinesherry.com/coffee.html), [Divyansh Kaushik](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dkaushik/index.html), [Akshay Narayan](https://akshayn.xyz/coffee.html), I have curated coffees I enjoyed in India and Amsterdam. I enjoy brewing with Aeropress and Mokapot (and sometimes espresso)!

#### Favorite cafes

<div class="cafe-intro" markdown="1">
I like these cafes for both the coffee selection and the foods they have. I have enjoyed both brewed specialty coffee and cappuccinos at these places.
</div>

<div class="content-list" markdown="1">
- **Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters, Bangalore** ¬∑ They source wonderful sourdough breads from Sour House India and have quite a delicious selection of open toasts.
- **Third Wave Coffee Roasters, Bangalore** ¬∑ Their selection of classic bagels is a perfect addition to your coffee.
- **Dyu Art Cafe, Bangalore** ¬∑ A pretty location and beautiful interiors. Their scrambled eggs are exactly how scrambled eggs are supposed to be: light and fluffy!
- **Roastery Coffee House, Hyderabad**
- **Feranoz, Hyderabad** ¬∑ The *best* patisserie in the city, their cakes and desserts are the best I've tasted so far! They have a good selection of coffee and freshly brewed teas to go with your desserts.
