## Coffee

Inspired by coffee pages from other researchers: [Justine Sherry](http://www.justinesherry.com/coffee.html), [Divyansh Kaushik](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dkaushik/index.html), [Akshay Narayan](https://akshayn.xyz/coffee.html), I have curated coffees I enjoyed in India.


### Favorite coffee roasters

I mainly brew with Aeropress, however, I sometimes enjoy French Press and (*every coffee connoisseur's nightmare*) instant coffee! I get coffee pre-ground until I decide to buy a hand grinder.

- Third Wave Coffee Roasters
- Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters
- Toffee Coffee Roasters
- KC Roasters
- _Instant Coffee_ from VS Mani Co.

### Favorite cafes

I like these cafes for both the coffee selection and the foods they have. I have enjoyed both brewed specialty coffee and cappuccinos at these places.

#### Bangalore

- **Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters**. They source wonderful sourdough breads from Sour House India and have quite a delicious selection of open toasts.
- **Third Wave Coffee Roasters**. Their selection of classic bagels is a perfect addition to your coffee.
- **Dyu Art Cafe**. A pretty location and beautiful interiors. Their scrambled eggs are exactly how scrambled eggs are supposed to be: light and fluffly!


#### Hyderabad

- **Roastery Coffee House**.
- **Eclaire Patisserie**.
- (Bonus) **Feranoz**. The *best* patisserie in the city, their cakes and desserts are the best I've tasted so far! They have a good selection of coffee and freshly brewed teas to go with your desserts.
