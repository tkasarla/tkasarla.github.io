Over time, I curated some awesome resources for (technical and non-technical parts of) research; most of which specific to Computer Vision, Machine Learning. I update this occasionally.

## How to research

### Do science right!
- [Research Culture and Community Norms](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs298-7/fa20/lectures/) from UC Berkeley has important discussions relating to the grad school experience. It's about the (often undiscussed) psychological, emotional counterpart of an academic journey. Prof. Justine Sherry also has a [similar reading list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L610weeNT_KDe6gPgjHjuN4rBSnsI0NfwE2RZCLuKgE/edit).

- [Good Citizen of CVPR](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/citizenofcvpr/) event held at CVPR 2018; of course, useful for all conference submissions!
- **Reproducibility in ML**: [Tools and Best Practices](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~ksinha4/practices_for_reproducibility/) blog.

### Writing Advice

- Scientific Writing by Stanford University on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sciwrite)
- [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP-LcFQlEyo) by Prof. Michal Lipson!
- [How To Write A Good Paper](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/citizenofcvpr/static/slides/malik_write_good_paper.pdf) by Prof. Jitendra Malik! In extension, this is from [Good Citizen of CVPR](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/citizenofcvpr/).

### Reading Papers

- [This paper](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf) on how to read a paper by [S. Keshav](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=-EMkK7QAAAAJ&hl=en), now a Professor of CS at University of Cambridge. I'd definitely recommend reading this!
- [Reading primary literature](https://caitkirby.com/resources/reading-primary-literature.html) by Cait Kirby. It's a short 1 page infographic on how to read papers.  
- [How to seriously read a scientific paper](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/03/how-seriously-read-scientific-paper) by Science Magazine!


### Reviewing Papers

- Amy Tabb's [blog post](https://amytabb.com/ts/2019_06_09/) on how to review technical papers when you've been not taught how!  
- [Reviewing for dummies](https://drimpossible.github.io/blog/life/reviewing_for_dummies/) blog post on [Ameya Prabhu's](https://drimpossible.github.io/about) webpage.
- CVPR 2020 tutorial on [How to Write a Good Review](https://sites.google.com/view/making-reviews-great-again)!
- CVPR 2021 has [training information](http://luthuli.cs.uiuc.edu/~daf/cvPR21trainingmaterials/) for reviewers!

### General Advice

- [23 things I didn't learn in grad school](https://twitter.com/dsivakumar/timelines/1328255107599802368) thread on twitter by [D. Sivakumar](https://twitter.com/dsivakumar).
- The very popular time management post, [Calendars. Not to-do lists](https://blog.usejournal.com/calendar-in-stead-of-to-do-lists-9ada86a512dd) by [Devi Parikh](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/)! A short trail run of this while applying to PhD positions proved it very useful for me. Plan to implement it more in the future.

### Applying to Grad School in CS

- [Krishna Murthy](http://krrish94.github.io) writes about grad school application [advice](http://krrish94.github.io/blog/gradschool-pick-school/) focusing on different factors that give a holistic view on choosing a school and advisor based on what is important to you.

- [A definitive guide](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Get-Advisor.pdf) to what do I look for/ask for in a PhD advisor curated by [Andrew Kuznetsov](https://twitter.com/andrewkuznet).

## The actual research

### Blogs

- [Machine Learning Glossary](https://yanndubs.github.io/machine-learning-glossary/) by [Yann Dubios](https://yanndubs.github.io/about/) that summarizes important terms and concepts of machine learning.
