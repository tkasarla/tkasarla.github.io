<span hidden class="abstract-hidden" style="border: 1px solid black; border-style: dashed; display:inline-block; font-size: 10pt; text-align: justify"> Maximizing the separation between classes constitutes a well-known inductive bias in machine learning and a pillar of many traditional algorithms. By default, deep networks are not equipped with this inductive bias and therefore many alternative solutions have been proposed through differential optimization. Current approaches tend to optimize classification and separation jointly: aligning inputs with class vectors and separating class vectors angularly. This paper proposes a simple alternative: encoding maximum separation as an inductive bias in the network by adding one fixed matrix multiplication before computing the softmax activations. The main observation behind our approach is that separation does not require optimization but can be solved in closed-form prior to training and plugged into a network. We outline a recursive approach to obtain the matrix consisting of maximally separable vectors for any number of classes, which can be added with negligible engineering effort and computational overhead. Despite its simple nature, this one matrix multiplication provides real impact. We show that our proposal directly boosts classification, long-tailed recognition, out-of-distribution detection, and open-set recognition, from CIFAR to ImageNet. We find empirically that maximum separation works best as a fixed bias; making the matrix learnable adds nothing to the performance. The closed-form implementation and code to reproduce the experiments are on github. </span>

<span hidden class="abstract-hidden" style="border: 1px solid black; border-style: dashed; display:inline-block; font-size: 10pt; text-align: justify"> As vision-based autonomous systems, such as self-driving vehicles, become a reality, there is an increasing need for large annotated datasets for developing solutions to vision tasks. One important task that has seen significant interest in recent years is semantic segmentation. However, the cost of annotating every pixel for semantic segmentation is immense, and can be prohibitive in scaling to various settings and locations. In this paper, we propose a region-based active learning method for efficient labeling in semantic segmentation.
Using the proposed active learning strategy, we show that we are able to judiciously select the regions for annotation such that we obtain 93.8% of the baseline performance (when all pixels are labeled) with addtional labeling of 10% of the total number of pixels. Further, we show that this approach can be used to transfer annotations from a model trained on a given dataset (Cityscapes) to a different dataset (Mapillary), thus highlighting its promise and potential. </span>
